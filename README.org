* Template for UTAU covers

** Usage

Some targets:

#+begin_src shell
make audio
make video
#+end_src

Tune in =ust/=. Each ust is rendered into a corresponding wav which you can reference during mixing.

You have to manually make sure the OutFile of every ust shares the same filename, so that for example =main.ust= renders to =main.wav=.

** Setup

#+begin_src shell
npx degit kisaragi-hiu/template-utau-cover new-project
#+end_src

Then change this line to point to the right command for UTAU:

#+begin_src makefile
UTAU = env WINEPREFIX=/home/kisaragi-hiu/.wineprefix/UTAU wine "C:\\Program Files (x86)\\UTAU\\utau.exe"
#+end_src

** project.edn

This file is in a personal format: see https://gitlab.com/kisaragi-hiu/experiment.project-metadata-format (name subject to change) for more examples.

** Extra stuff

- Trimming the exported file if it doesn't match the video ::

  #+begin_src makefile
/tmp/trimmed.wav: export.wav
	ffmpeg -y -i export.wav -ss 500ms /tmp/trimmed.wav

export.mkv: Original.mp4 /tmp/trimmed.wav
	ffmpeg -y \
	    -i "$<" -i /tmp/trimmed.wav \
	    -map "0:v" -map "1:a" \
	    -c:v copy -c:a aac -b:a 320k \
	    "$@"
  #+end_src
